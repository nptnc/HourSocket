# ‚ö†Ô∏è HourSocket is currently patched! 
Byfron has been released to both the normal Roblox client and the Microsoft Store version of Roblox.  
This means that if you DO end up injecting in to Roblox you are at risk of being banned by Roblox, most executors will not let you though.


# HourSocket <sub>a multiplayer mod for [Hours](https://www.roblox.com/games/5732973455/HOURS)</sub>

## How do I play?
If you're stupid, here's a video tutorial on how to play on a [public server](https://google.com/) or [private server](https://google.com/).

### Creating a server
- [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/) (If you already have Python, skip this step)
- Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/nptnc/HourSocket`
- Port Forward `7171` and optionally `4040`
- Run `main.py` and optionally `webserver.py`

### Connecting to a server
- Using an executor of your choice (we suggest [Synapse X](https://x.synapse.to)<sub>Patched</sub> or [krnl](https://krnl.place)<sub>Patched</sub>)
- Inject in to Roblox using your executor
- Optionally set your server's IP and Port (If you aren't using a private server you can skip this step)
- Execute the script! üëç
