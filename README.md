## Setup

### Don't wanna do all the fancy setup stuff?
just download the client script and run it when you're in hours and spawned in, it'll automatically connect to the public server!

### Server
1. download latest python!!! (was written in 3.11)
2. download server under server directory in this repo
3. `python3 main.py` to run server
4. if you want the webserver as well run `python3 webserver.py` as well

### Client
1. get an executor (only tested on [krnl](https://krnl.place))
2. run the script 👍
