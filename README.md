## Setup

### Don't wanna do all the fancy setup stuff?
just download the client script and run it when you're in hours and spawned in, it'll automatically connect to the public server!

### Server
1. download latest python!!! (was written in 3.11)
2. download server under server directory in this repo
3. `python3 main.py` to run server
4. if you want the webserver as well run `python3 webserver.py` as well
5. you'll have to port forward 7171 for the actual server and 4040 for the webserver.

### Client
1. get an executor (only tested on [krnl](https://krnl.place))
2. download and open the microsoft store roblox <sub>why?, microsoft store roblox doesnt have [Byfron](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/welcoming-byfron-to-roblox/2018233)</sub>
3. run the script üëç

### Connecting to custom servers on client
you have to edit the variable "ip" and "port" in the client script, should be somewhere near the top.
